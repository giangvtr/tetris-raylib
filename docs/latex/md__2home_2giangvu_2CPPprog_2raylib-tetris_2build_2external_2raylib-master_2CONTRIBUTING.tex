\item raylib is a tool to {\bfseries{ENJOY}} videogames programming, every function in raylib is designed as a mini-\/tutorial on itself.
\item raylib is {\bfseries{SIMPLE}} and {\bfseries{EASY-\/\+TO-\/\+USE}}, I tried to keep it compact with a small set of functions, if a function is too complex, better not including it.
\item raylib is open source and free; educators and institutions can use this tool to {\bfseries{TEACH}} videogames programming completely for free.
\item raylib is collaborative; contribution of tutorials / code examples / bug fixes / code comments are highly appreciated.
\item raylib\textquotesingle{}s license (and its external libs respective licenses) allow using raylib on commercial projects.

\href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki}{\texttt{ raylib Wiki}} contains some information about the library and is open to anyone to edit. Feel free to review it if required, just take care not to break something.\hypertarget{md__2home_2giangvu_2CPPprog_2raylib-tetris_2build_2external_2raylib-master_2CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{raylib C coding conventions}{raylib C coding conventions}}\label{md__2home_2giangvu_2CPPprog_2raylib-tetris_2build_2external_2raylib-master_2CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md7}
Despite being written in C, raylib does not follow the standard Hungarian notation for C, it \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/raylib-coding-conventions}{\texttt{ follows Pascal-\/case/camel-\/case notation}}, more common in C\# language. All code formatting decisions have been carefully taken to make it easier for students/users to read, write and understand code.

Source code is extensively commented for that purpose, raylib primary learning method is\+:

For detailed information on building raylib and examples, please check \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki}{\texttt{ raylib Wiki}}.\hypertarget{md__2home_2giangvu_2CPPprog_2raylib-tetris_2build_2external_2raylib-master_2CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Opening new Issues}{Opening new Issues}}\label{md__2home_2giangvu_2CPPprog_2raylib-tetris_2build_2external_2raylib-master_2CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md8}
To open new issues for raylib (bug, enhancement, discussion...), just try to follow these rules\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure the issue has not already been reported before by searching on Git\+Hub under Issues.
\item If you\textquotesingle{}re unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample demonstrating the unexpected behavior.
\item If applicable, attach some screenshot of the issue and a .zip file with the code sample and required resources.
\item On issue description, add a brackets tag about the raylib module that relates to this issue. If don\textquotesingle{}t know which module, just report the issue, I will review it.
\item You can check other issues to see how it\textquotesingle{}s being done!

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t send big pull requests (lots of changelists), they are difficult to review. It\textquotesingle{}s better to send small pull requests, one at a time.
\item Verify that changes don\textquotesingle{}t break the build (at least on Windows platform). The more platforms where you can test it, the better, but don\textquotesingle{}t worry if you cannot test all the platforms.
