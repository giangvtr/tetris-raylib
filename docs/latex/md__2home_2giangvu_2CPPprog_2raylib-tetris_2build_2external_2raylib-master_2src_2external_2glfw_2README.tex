 This directory contains a modification of GLFW, whose official website and upstream repository are \href{https://glfw.org}{\texttt{ https\+://glfw.\+org}} and \href{https://github.com/glfw/glfw}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/glfw/glfw}}, respectively.

In this modification, some static functions sharing the same name in different platforms have been renamed so all of GLFW\textquotesingle{}s source files can be combined into one (as done by {\ttfamily rglfw.\+c}). Also, the Null platform, which is not used by raylib, has been disabled. The renamed functions are\+:

{\ttfamily  create\+Key\+Tables() translate\+Key() acquire\+Monitor() release\+Monitor() }
